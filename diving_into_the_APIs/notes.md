# difference between js object vs json:

Here’s a clear and easy explanation of the difference between JavaScript Object and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

1. Definition

JavaScript Object: A real data structure used in JavaScript to store key–value pairs.

JSON : A text-based data format used to represent structured data — mainly for data exchange between a client and server.

2. Syntax Difference

JavaScript Object Example:
const person = {
  name: "Vishal",
  age: 22,
  isStudent: true
};

JSON Example:
{
  "name": "Vishal",
  "age": 22,
  "isStudent": true
}

Notice:

In JSON, keys must be in double quotes " ".
In JS Object, keys can be without quotes.
JSON can only contain data — no functions or methods.
